# FYSR-GC
Prognostic Prediction for Five-Year Survival of Gastric Cancer

The five-year survival rate (FYSR) prediction model combined with genetic information provides a marker index to predict patient survival rate. Firstly, this work offers a novel model construction strategy that can serve as a benchmark for clinical cancer applications, such as the development of a recurrence and metastasis early warning model and a model for auxiliary guide drug. Secondly, the CCA model developed in conjunction with tumor-related mutations can be used as a novel analysis tool in the research of tumor genesis and development mechanisms, allowing for the extraction of more meaningful data. Thirdly, the FYSR model can assist clinicians in evaluating patient prognoses and, to some extent, improving clinical treatment plans. An FYSR model can be developed to assess patient prognosis by detecting mutations in this type of gene and comparing them using the CCA model. Given that the current sequencing means are expected to be implemented and popularized.
