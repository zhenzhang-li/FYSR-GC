GC168_test：This data set is derived from the data of 《Whole genome sequencing receives new levels of contribution hotspots and a diagnostic multiple signature in genetic cancer》. Here, RNMF is used to decompose this data set first, and then CCA model is used to calculate the cumulative contribution abundance information under each characteristic. The sample prognosis of the current data set can be obtained by inputting the information matrix into the training model.
